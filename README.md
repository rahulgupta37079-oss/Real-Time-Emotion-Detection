## üìä Data Architecture

### Data Models
- **Emotion Object**: 
  ```javascript
  {
    name: String,      // e.g., "Happy", "Sad"
    value: Number,     // 0-100 percentage
    color: String,     // Tailwind color class
    icon: String       // FontAwesome icon class
  }
  ```

### Storage Services
- **No persistent storage**: All processing happens client-side in the browser
- **Privacy-first approach**: No data is transmitted to servers or stored

### Data Flow
1. User grants camera/microphone permissions
2. Media streams captured via WebRTC
3. Real-time analysis simulated in browser
4. Results displayed instantly with smooth animations
5. All data processing local - nothing leaves the device

## üöÄ User Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Open the Application**: Navigate to the application URL
2. **Grant Permissions**: Click "Start Detection" and allow camera/microphone access when prompted
3. **View Results**: Watch real-time emotion detection results update automatically

### Understanding the Interface

- Recording indicator (pulsing red glow) when active
- Status badge (top-right): Shows connection status
- Face counter (top-left): Number of detected faces

#### Emotion Analysis Panel
- 7 emotion bars showing probability percentages
- Each emotion has a unique color and icon
- Bars update in real-time with smooth transitions

#### Score Cards
- **Combined Score**: Overall emotion intensity (0-100%)
- **Facial Score**: Emotion detected from facial expressions
- **Voice Score**: Emotion detected from voice tone with audio level bars

#### System Status
- Real-time status of camera, microphone, and AI models
- Helps troubleshoot permission or hardware issues

### Tips for Best Results
- Ensure good lighting for facial detection
- Position face clearly in camera view
- Speak naturally for voice analysis
- Allow both camera and microphone permissions
